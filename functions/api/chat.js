-This equals all cost outs and charges to the job\n.\nSALE PRICE\n -This is the contract price agreed upon by you and the homeowners\n.\nCOMMISSIONABLE PRICE\n -This is the sale price minus any ˜nancing fees and the admin fee\n.\nPAR PRICE\n -This is retail price minus 35%\n.\nAcceptable Pricing is Retail price to 65% of Retail\n.\nPar is 65% of Retail\n.\nA sale that is 64\n.\n99 - 60 % of retail pays 5%\n.\nA sale that is 59\n.\n99 - 55% of retail pays 2%\n.\nAll sales have an admin fee of $400 tak en off of the sale price\n.\nAny ˜nancing fees are taken off of the sales price before the admin fee\n.\n\n20\nTHE SALES PROCESS\n\noff of the sale price\n.\nAny ˜nancing fees are taken off of the sales price before the admin fee\n.\n\n20\nTHE SALES PROCESS\n\n21\nYour goal as a LeafFilter representative is to make as many sales to as many prospects as we can\n.\n In \norder to do this you must give a presentation - called a demo - to as many prospects as you can\n.\n If you \ndo not demo the lead, it is impossible to make the sale\n.\nYour presentation is an important and proven \nopportunity to help each homeowner feel more con˜dent and informed about our product\n.\nWhat follows is an outline of the sales process\n.\n The steps listed are what you as a sales rep should \nstri ve for on every appointment\n.\n Periodically, it will be necessary to do these steps in a different order \nor fashion– the goal, however, will remain the same\n.\nWhen you cannot do the steps in the prescribed \nfashion, this is known as \"creati ve selling\n.\n\" Oftentimes, creative selling entails customizing your \npresentation to the needs of a speci˜c lead\n.\n \nSTEP 1 - THE WARM UP\nIts a fact that consumers buy from people they like and trust\n.\nWhen you ˜r st gree\n\npeci˜c lead\n.\n \nSTEP 1 - THE WARM UP\nIts a fact that consumers buy from people they like and trust\n.\nWhen you ˜r st greet your prospect, you \nshould ensure that the things you can control are tak en care of: youre on time, clothes are neat and \npressed, youre wearing a LeafFilter shirt or jack et, and all samples are clean and accounted for\n.\n  \nŁ\n \nThis step is called the warm-up because the goal for the salesman is to ˜nd a subject that \nthe homeowner can warm up to\n.\n Everyone likes to talk about themselves or their own interests\n.\n Pay \nattention to things in and around the home that will show this homeowner s interests, and then talk \nabout them\n.\n Start a conver sation about these interests to get the prospect comfortable with sharing \ninformation with you\n.\n  \nKeep in mind that the customer has invited us to their house knowing that we are going to try to sell \nthem\n.\nThey will naturally have a wall of defense that you need to breach in order to be able to close the \nsale\n.\n In order to create trust, they need to like you and believe that youre an expert\n.\nYoull need to draw\n\nose the \nsale\n.\n In order to create trust, they need to like you and believe that youre an expert\n.\nYoull need to draw \nthe customer out and engage them in conver sations about their interests\n.\n \nWhile outside, you can begin your plan of attack for Step 2 of the sales process\n.\nA salespersons ear s \nare the most important weapon they have in their ar senal, so be sure youre using your s\n.\n Customer s \nwill always gi ve you information in this step that will help you close the sale\n.\n\nure youre using your s\n.\n Customer s \nwill always gi ve you information in this step that will help you close the sale\n.\n\n22\nSTEP 2 - THE INSPECTION\nIt is imperative that on each and every job you do a walk-around inspection with the homeowners\n.\n  Our \ngoal in this step is threefold:\n \nŁ\n \nEstablish that you are an expert\n.\n \nŁ\n \nIdentify the need for our product\n.\n \nŁ\n \nCreate urgency for the job\n.\nYou establish that you are an expert by asking pointed questions pertaining to potential problems they \nmay currently have, or identifying potential areas of concern\n.\n  Every home has a problem of some sort \nwith their current gutter and/or gutter protection system\n.\n While doing a walk-around, be a detecti ve and \nlook for clues to increase the customers urgency and sense of need\n.\n  Some of these clues are:\n  \nŁ\n\ndetecti ve and \nlook for clues to increase the customers urgency and sense of need\n.\n  Some of these clues are:\n  \nŁ  \n \n\nT iger striping indicates over˚ow from clogs or poorly pitched gutter s\n.\nT iger striping is easily \nidenti˜ed as vertical marks or stripes on the front face of a gutter\n.\nThis is caused by poor pitch \nor clogged, over˚owing gutter s and downspouts\n.\n The water in the gutter has oils from the \nshingles that leave permanent dark marks\n.\n  \nŁ  \n \nGutter s that are loose or pulling away from the fascia board are usually caused by loosening \nspik es\n.\n Just lik e with nails, spikes on older gutters can loosen over time\n.\nThis is exacerbated by \na gutter that is full of debris and water, and its much wor se in the winter when ice adds weight \nin the gutter\n.\n  \nŁ  \n \nErosion of dirt or mulch may indicate over˚ow from a clog\n.\nTypically, a gutter will clog at the \nmouth of the downspout\n.\n If theres a clog here, youll notice a depression or other signs of \nerosion at the base of the downspout\n.\n Many times, the homeowner will also notice moisture in \ntheir basement clos\n\nof \nerosion at the base of the downspout\n.\n Many times, the homeowner will also notice moisture in \ntheir basement close to this problem area\n.\n Look for splashed dirt, mulch, or mud on the side of \nthe house\n.\n If you spot erosion issues, ask about them!\n \nŁ  \n \n\nAny existing gutter guards are lik ely ineffecti ve since the homeowner is seeking a better \nsolution\n.\n If they have gutter protection already, ˜nd out what they lik e or dislik e about what \nthey have currently\n.\nThis is very important! If you listen well,THEYWILLTELLYOU EXACTLY \nHOW TO SELL THEM AND WHAT THEY EXPECT!\nŁ  \n \n\nTwisted, warped, or improperly pitched gutters are easy to spot\n.\n If there is a swale or low point in the \ngutter, ask if they over˚ow at that spot\n.\n Explain how wood soaks up and absorbs moisture\n...\n if the \nfascia board gets wet, then the rafter tails get wet, then the roof decking gets wet, and so on\n.\n\nmoisture\n...\n if the \nfascia board gets wet, then the rafter tails get wet, then the roof decking gets wet, and so on\n.\n\n23\nNever forget to ask a customer how they clean their gutter s now\n.\n By bringing it to the top of their mind, \nwe are reinforcing and reminding them how unpleasant and dangerous it can be to k eep gutter s clean\n.\nTIE DOWN\n -\"I imagine that you see the bene˜t in making your gutter s maintenance-free while \nprotecting your largest investment? Would you agree that projects that protect us and our largest \ninvestment are best done sooner rather than later?\"\nSTEP 3 - COMPANY STORY\nIn this step, we need to convey that LeafFilter is the only company for their job\n.\n  We do this by \nestablishing our companys credentials, longevity, and satisfaction rating\n.\n We ultimately want to \nestablish that we can be trusted and that were committed to their satisfaction\n.\n  Remember to ask \nquestions and listen to what the homeowner tells you\n.\n  \n \n\"Have you ever hired a contractor to do work on your house and how did it go?\"\nIf the customers prior experience with a contractor wa\n\nr hired a contractor to do work on your house and how did it go?\"\nIf the customers prior experience with a contractor was bad, listen closely; theyre going to tell you \nexactly what NOTTO DO!Then, you can tailor your pitch to reassure the customer that that will not \nhappen with us\n.\n If it was a good experience, youll still garner useful insight that can help you tailor \nyour pitch\n.\n  \nThe most effective sales reps don t\"pitch\" a prospect; they have a conver sation with them\n.\nThis is \nbecause they understand the power of the most basic maxim in professional sales\n...\n If you tell a \nprospect something, they may or may not believe you\n.\n However, if you can get the prospect to tell YOU \nthat same something, that becomes fact to the customer\n.\n \n  \nŁ\n  \nBe sure to ask,\"When you have work done on your home, what qualities or traits do you \nlook for in a company that youre going to hire?\" Listen closely\n.\nThe prospect is on the \nverge of telling you what they want\n...\n tailor your presentation accordingly\n.\n \nŁ\n \nWe have been in business since 2005\n \nŁ\n \nOver the year s we have grown\n\n.\n tailor your presentation accordingly\n.\n \nŁ\n \nWe have been in business since 2005\n \nŁ\n \nOver the year s we have grown into a $2 billion company\n.\n \nŁ\n \nLeaf Home now has over 175 locations, and were still growing!\n \nŁ\n  \nWe are the exclusi ve LeafFilter manufacturer for the entire country and Canada, selling \nalmost 40 million feet a year\n.\n \nŁ\n  \nWe are not only a Better Business Bureau Member, but also a Gold StarAward winner (3 \nconsecuti ve years in a row without a complaint)!\n \nŁ\n  \nThe #1 rated gutter protection system according to Consumer Reports Magazine\n.\n -

Thats usually \nthe case, but there are a few more things about gutter protection that you still don t know\n.\n\"\n \n\"You see, shopping for gutter protection isn t lik e shopping for car s, TVs, or refrigerator s\n.\n Lets \nconsider a TV, for example\n.\n You pick out a model you lik e and you check two or three places for the exact \nmodel and whoever has the cheapest price is who youre going to buy your TV from\n.\n You know that the \ncheapest model was made at the same place under the same conditions as the same model that was \nmore expensi ve at the other store right? And thats the way that most retail purchases work\n.\n\nthe same model that was \nmore expensi ve at the other store right? And thats the way that most retail purchases work\n.\n But gutter \nprotection is completely different\n.\n\"\n \n\"To put it simply, you can t shop around for LeafFilter! Let me explain why\n.\n Remember when I \nshowed you how most home improvement projects work? And how LeafFilter is different because we \nhandle the whole process our selves? You said you de˜nitely lik ed the LeafFilter and that was what you \nwanted on your house\n.\n We are the exclusi ve dealer, so you cant get the LeafFilter anywhere else\n.\n\"\n \n\"Now, lets assume you did ˜nd a product you lik ed (although we all know you won t\n.\n)  You will \nhire a contractor, who will buy it from a distributor who bought it from the manufacturer and who will \nthen pay a sub-contractor to put it in\n.\n  All that is ˜ne until there is a problem and you need service\n.\n  Then \nwho are you going to call? Again there is a good chance that you are going to get left holding the bag\n.\n  Is \nit worth that risk just to save a couple bucks?\"\n \n\"Let me remind you again that here at LeafFil\n\nholding the bag\n.\n  Is \nit worth that risk just to save a couple bucks?\"\n \n\"Let me remind you again that here at LeafFilter we handle every step of your installation\n.\n Our \nlifetime transferable warranty and clog-free guarantee ensures a lifetime of peace of mind\n.\n No one else \nhas that, and I know thats important to you\n.\n\" \n\n51\n \n\"So to sum it all up doesn t it mak e sense to go with a sure thing, a product that doesn t interfere \nwith your roof, one that will not let even a grain of sand into your gutter and back ed by a company you \nknow you can trust?  So can we go ahead and give it a try?\"\n4. ALTERNATIVE \"THINK ABOUT IT\" REBUTTAL\n \n\"Thats great Mr\n.\n Jones!

different and need to be handled as such\n.\n A one-leg appointment refer s \nto a lead where only one homeowner is present\n.\n  Sometimes that homeowner does have the capability of  \nmaking the decision without speaking to the other per son\n.\n  Sometimes that homeowner will use that fact  \nto put off the decision\n.\n  In this case, we need an alternati ve strategy to trying to sell that prospect\n.\nThe standard steps of the presentation remain the same\n.\nWe still need to warm up, do a great  \npresentation, eliminate the competition, and price condition\n.\nYoull ˜nd out whether they will be able to \nmake the decision without the other homeowner present when you get to the pre-close\n.\n If the homeowner  \ngi ves an objection after your pre-close attempt, then you should roll into a secondary at\n\ne-close\n.\n If the homeowner  \ngi ves an objection after your pre-close attempt, then you should roll into a secondary attempt\n.\nThere are two effecti ve ways of dealing with a one-leg\n.\n1\n.  \nWhen initially showing the Retail Price,Do not in˚ate it, show the actual retail pricing \nfor the job\n.\nThis allows us to give a discount down to the par price without losing our \ncredibility\n.\nAfter the ˜rst price is shown, you should still do an add, subtract, multiply \nand di vide\n.\nWhen you ask the homeowner what they think, they will almost always say, \n\"Looks good, I just have to talk to my spouse\n.\n\"\nNow you should attempt two things\n.\n  The ˜r st is focus on what they would do if it was just up to them\n.\n \nThe second is to ˜nd out when the other homeowner will be home and how soon they can talk about it\n.\n \nYou may have to lead them down this path:\n \n\"So Mr\n.\n Jones let me ask you, what time does your wife get home?\"\n \n\"When she gets back, I trust you will tell her that I was here and what we talk ed about?\"\n \n\"So you will tell her that in your opinion this is by far the best product ava\n\nI was here and

time to set up the close\n.\n First, tell the homeowner that you have a way to save them a  \nconsiderable amount of money\n.\nTell them about the commercial pricing, and ask that they let us know their decision by 9 a\n.\nm\n.\n tomorrow\n.\n \nThis is when we must have the product for the commercial job ordered\n.\nFill out and leave behind a contract (without the homeowner signing it) so that their spouse can see it  \nand under stand exactly what were proposing\n.\n Leave the prospect a folder with a one-leg brochure, the  \ncontract, and a business card\n.\n \nTHE PRICE YOU THEN OFFER THE HOMEOWNER SHOULD BE $100 OVER PAR***\n \nThen mak e sure you follow up with the homeowner before the time you gave them\n.\n \n2\n.  \nAnother way to attempt to close the sale is to just
