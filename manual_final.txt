THE SALES PROCESS

21
Your goal as a LeafFilter representative is to make as many sales to as many prospects as we can
.
 In 
order to do this you must give a presentation - called a demo - to as many prospects as you can
.
 If you 
do not demo the lead, it is impossible to make the sale
.
Your presentation is an important and proven 
opportunity to help each homeowner feel more con˜dent and informed about our product
.
What follows is an outline of the sales process
.
 The steps listed are what you as a sales rep should 
stri ve for on every appointment
.
 Periodically, it will be necessary to do these steps in a different order 
or fashion– the goal, however, will remain the same
.
When you cannot do the steps in the prescribed 
fashion, this is known as "creati ve selling
.
" Oftentimes, creative selling entails customizing your 
presentation to the needs of a speci˜c lead
.
 
STEP 1 - THE WARM UP
Its a fact that consumers buy from people they like and trust

.
 
STEP 1 - THE WARM UP
Its a fact that consumers buy from people they like and trust
.
When you ˜r st greet your prospect, you 
should ensure that the things you can control are tak en care of: youre on time, clothes are neat and 
pressed, youre wearing a LeafFilter shirt or jack et, and all samples are clean and accounted for
.
  
Ł
 
This step is called the warm-up because the goal for the salesman is to ˜nd a subject that 
the homeowner can warm up to
.
 Everyone likes to talk about themselves or their own interests
.
 Pay 
attention to things in and around the home that will show this homeowner s interests, and then talk 
about them
.
 Start a conver sation about these interests to get the prospect comfortable with sharing 
information with you
.
  
Keep in mind that the customer has invited us to their house knowing that we are going to try to sell 
them
.
They will naturally have a wall of defense that you need to breach in order to be able to close the 
sale
.
 In order to create trust, they need to like you and believe that youre an expert
.
Youll need to draw

sale
.

.
Youll need to draw 
the customer out and engage them in conver sations about their interests

While outside, you can begin your plan of attack for Step 2 of the sales process
.
A salespersons ear s 
are the most important weapon they have in their ar senal, so be sure youre using your s

22
STEP 2 - THE INSPECTION
It is imperative that on each and every job you do a walk-around inspection with the homeowners
.
  Our 
goal in this step is threefold:
 
Ł
 
Establish that you are an expert
.
 
Ł
 
Identify the need for our product
.
 
Ł
 
Create urgency for the job
.
You establish that you are an expert by asking pointed questions pertaining to potential problems they 
may currently have, or identifying potential areas of concern
.
  Every home has a problem of some sort 
with their current gutter and/or gutter protection system
.
 While doing a walk-around, be a detecti ve and 
look for clues to increase the customers urgency and sense of need
.
  Some of these clues are:
  
Ł

detecti ve and 
look for clues to increase the customers urgency and sense of need
.
  Some of these clues are:
  
Ł  
 

T iger striping indicates over˚ow from clogs or poorly pitched gutter s
.
T iger striping is easily 
identi˜ed as vertical marks or stripes on the front face of a gutter
.
This is caused by poor pitch 
or clogged, over˚owing gutter s and downspouts
.
 The water in the gutter has oils from the 
shingles that leave permanent dark marks
.
  
Ł  
 
Gutter s that are loose or pulling away from the fascia board are usually caused by loosening 
spik es
.
 Just lik e with nails, spikes on older gutters can loosen over time
.
This is exacerbated by 
a gutter that is full of debris and water, and its much wor se in the winter when ice adds weight 
in the gutter
.
  
Ł  
 
Erosion of dirt or mulch may indicate over˚ow from a clog
.
Typically, a gutter will clog at the 
mouth of the downspout
.
 If theres a clog here, youll notice a depression or other signs of 
erosion at the base of the downspout
.
 Many times, the homeowner will also notice moisture in 
their basement clos

of 
erosion at the base of the downspout
.
 Many times, the homeowner will also notice moisture in 
their basement close to this problem area
.
 Look for splashed dirt, mulch, or mud on the side of 
the house
.
 If you spot erosion issues, ask about them!
 
Ł  
 

Any existing gutter guards are lik ely ineffecti ve since the homeowner is seeking a better 
solution
.
 If they have gutter protection already, ˜nd out what they lik e or dislik e about what 
they have currently
.
This is very important! If you listen well,THEYWILLTELLYOU EXACTLY 
HOW TO SELL THEM AND WHAT THEY EXPECT!
Ł  
 

Twisted, warped, or improperly pitched gutters are easy to spot
.
 If there is a swale or low point in the 
gutter, ask if they over˚ow at that spot
.
 Explain how wood soaks up and absorbs moisture
...
 if the 
fascia board gets wet, then the rafter tails get wet, then the roof decking gets wet, and so on
.

moisture
...
 if the 
fascia board gets wet, then the rafter tails get wet, then the roof decking gets wet, and so on
.

23
Never forget to ask a customer how they clean their gutter s now
.
 By bringing it to the top of their mind, 
we are reinforcing and reminding them how unpleasant and dangerous it can be to k eep gutter s clean
.
TIE DOWN
 -"I imagine that you see the bene˜t in making your gutter s maintenance-free while 
protecting your largest investment? Would you agree that projects that protect us and our largest 
investment are best done sooner rather than later?"
STEP 3 - COMPANY STORY
In this step, we need to convey that LeafFilter is the only company for their job
.
  We do this by 
establishing our companys credentials, longevity, and satisfaction rating
.
 We ultimately want to 
establish that we can be trusted and that were committed to their satisfaction
.
  Remember to ask 
questions and listen to what the homeowner tells you
.
  
 
"Have you ever hired a contractor to do work on your house and how did it go?"
If the customers prior experience with a contractor wa

r hired a contractor to do work on your house and how did it go?"
If the customers prior experience with a contractor was bad, listen closely; theyre going to tell you 
exactly what NOTTO DO!Then, you can tailor your pitch to reassure the customer that that will not 
happen with us
.
 If it was a good experience, youll still garner useful insight that can help you tailor 
your pitch
.
  
The most effective sales reps don t"pitch" a prospect; they have a conver sation with them
.
This is 
because they understand the power of the most basic maxim in professional sales
...
 If you tell a 
prospect something, they may or may not believe you
.
 However, if you can get the prospect to tell YOU 
that same something, that becomes fact to the customer
.
 
  
Ł
  
Be sure to ask,"When you have work done on your home, what qualities or traits do you 
look for in a company that youre going to hire?" Listen closely
.
The prospect is on the 
verge of telling you what they want
...
 tailor your presentation accordingly

It is very important to set our selves apart from the competition

  We do this by doing 
things differently
.
  
MOST HOME IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS FOLLOW A FAIRLY TYPICAL PATH:
1
.
 
GENERAL CONTRACTOR
 -You hire a company to do the work
.
2
.
 
SUB-CONTRACTOR
 - Contractor hires someone to do the installation
.
3
.
 
RETAIL/WHOLESALE OUTLET
 - Sells product to the contractor
.
4
.
 
DISTRIBUTOR
 - Ships product from manufacturer to outlets
.
5
.
 
MANUFACTURER
 - Mak es the actual product
.
The problem with doing business this way is that when the homeowner has a problem or ser
 
vice issue, 
theyre often unsure who to call to take care of it
.

theyre often unsure who to call to take care of it

 Regardless of whom they choose to contact, the odds 
are high that blame will be placed on another party

there is op

house?
STEP 4 - THE PRODUCT DEMO
This step must be done with enthusiasm and excitement
.
Were going to educate the prospect about 
gutter protection choices and why LeafFilter is the only logi
 
cal choice

Step 4 goals:
 
Ł
 
Eliminate the competition

Price conditioning

Remove shop-around objections

Establish LeafFilter as the only solution
Our focus in this step is going to be two major points that we want to dri ve home to the homeowner

 You should never ever consider a product that installs underne

points that we want to dri ve home to the homeowner
.
 
 You should never ever consider a product that installs underneath your shingles

  If you are looking to k eep debris out of your gutter, then be sure you choose a product that 
  
     has NO openings, gaps, slots or louvers that will clog

Frame the presentation as a conver sation and talk with prospects about what other choices they have
.
 
It is important to control the conversation and systematically show and explain the other choices that 
are available
.
As you show each product and explain how it is installed, ask the customer what they 
think will happen with each one
.
 Since we al
 
ready know how many linear feet they have, we can inform 
them of how much each product would cost installed on their house
.
After that is done, tie the customer 
down with, 
 
"Is this a product you would put on your house?"
After you go through all competing products, the prospect will lik ely tell you,"No, I wouldn t put that 
on my house
.
"This is how you effecti vely eliminate the competition and remove the shop-around

I wouldn t put that 
on my house
.
"This is how you effecti vely eliminate the competition and remove the shop-around 
objection
.
 
An effecti ve transition statement into this step is, "So what do you know about gutter protection?"  
It is most effective to start this step by introducing the most expensi ve products and working up to the 
cheapest ones
.
Remember that your goal is to educate the prospect so they can mak e a good decision
.
 Reinforce that 
to be a truly effective lifetime solution, the product must do three things:
 
1
. 
Eliminate a gutter from clogging
.
 
2
. 
Reduce any type of maintenance
.
 
3
. 
Not disturb the roof or shingles in any fashion
.
  
 
 
If a product cannot do all of those things it is not a wise investment, it is a waste of money 
AND time!

HOME DEPOT DIY SCREENS.   $3-$4/FOOT INSTALLED.
"Have you ever seen this?" Explain how that this product is clipped onto the lip of the gutter and 
tuck ed under shingles
.
 Point out the size of the holes in the product and ask,"What do you think 
will happen with spinners and pine needles? Even though this would only cost a couple of hundred 
dollar s is this something you would waste your money on?"
Price Conditioning - The purpose of price conditioning is two-fold
.
 You are essentially shopping with 
the prospect
.
 Point out the problems and pitfalls of each competing product, get the prospect to say 
that product isn t something they would consider, and then inform them of how much each solution 
would cost
.
To do this effecti vely, the prospect must trust and believe that you are indeed an expert
.
 
In order to price condition most effecti vely, tak e the linear foot total of their house and multiply by 
an average price per foot for each product
.
 D

ffecti vely, tak e the linear foot total of their house and multiply by 
an average price per foot for each product
.
 Don t just tell a prospect that it is four dollar s a foot or 
twenty eight a foot - put the total cost into perspecti ve for them
.

At a house that needs 150 feet of gutter protection, you might say, "It would cost $60 0 to put these 
Home Depot screens on your house
.
 Would you pay $60 0 for something that you know wont work?" 
The other goal of price conditioning is to get the customer used to hearing prices in the thousands
.
 
Then, they wont be surprised by cost when we get to the close

LeafFilter uses the most effecti ve debris-blocking and water-handling technology on the mark et
.
 
LeafFilter s surgical grade stainless steel screen won t rust or corrode, and it is positioned at the 
optimal angle to shed debris
.
 It offer s a unique approach to gutter protection that can t be found 
in competing brands with reverse-curve technology, perforations, or channels
.
LeafFilter s stainless steel micromesh screen blocks particles as small as shingle grit, preventing 
it from entering and clogging a gutter system
.
 Its distinguished scienti˜c design uses surface 
tension and touchpoints to draw water directly into the gutter while k eeping debris out
.
Even with pine needles, oak tassels, or other debris on top of LeafFilter, water ˚ows through and 
under debris
.
 As it mak es contact with the micromesh screen, water is drawn into the gutter and 
channeled away from the home– NOT cascading over a clogged gutter!

OVERVIEW
Your goal is to create the proper conditions to close the sale by"pre-closing on price and payment
.
" 
The presentation has brought the prospects to an impasse in their buying decision
.
At this point in 
your presentation, the question remains, "Can we afford it?" If the representati ve has performed 
these ˜r st steps properly, the remaining issue or ˜nal consideration would have to be the total cost
.
The impression you want to instill in the prospects minds is that LeafFilter is the best product on 
the mark et today
.
PRE CLOSE ON PRICE AND PAYMENT
Now, at this point in the presentation the objective is to clarify that only two factor s remaining: 
price and terms
.
Ł
 
This installation is something you want to do, if not now
...
 then sometime in the future, 
right John, right Mary?
Ł
 
Because it is not a matter of if you will do this project, but when, let me show you how 
to save a lot of money by considering this now
.
 (Do not hesitate
.
)

to save a lot of money by considering this now
.
 (Do not hesitate
.
)
Ł
 
If I can show you a way to save a lot of money and work out a price
...
 or maybe even a 
payment that ˜ts into your budget, then
...
Ł
 
Would there be any reason besides price or payment why you wouldn t consider 
getting this project started while Im here today
.

38
SECONDARY PRE-CLOSE COMMITMENT 
Unfortunately, you may get resistance to your request to do business today
.
 Never leave the home 
without offering the prospect a price and attempting to close the sale
.
 If you get stiff resistance, you 
may ˜nd it necessary to soften your request to purchase today if the price is right
.
 The Secondary 
Pre-Close is effecti ve with a dif˜cult prospect that states,"I never mak e a decision in one day
.
" Key 
Points in using the Secondary Pre-Close:
Ł
 
John and Mary, we have spent a lot of time here today
.
Ł
 
Can you do me a personal favor?
Ł
 
Can you just keep an open mind to a fair business proposition?

 Build value, be thorough about 
speci˜cs (colors, size, and work-scope), and be sure prospect is comfortable with the 
terms of the project

Present price and payment options, clarifying payment ˜r st
.
"And believe it or not the 
whole thing comes to only thirty ˜ve hundred
.
  When you do this would that be check, 
credit card, or would you take advantage of our ˜nancing?"And quote a payment of 
2

15% of the price or $35, whichever is greater

If the answer is check, cash, or credit card we need to ensure that the price is actually 
affordable to the prospect

with that?
 
2

Expecting - After seeing Bottom Line Secrets saying expect to spend $3,50 0-$60 0 0, and the 
product and all the tune-up we do to your gutter s, Im sure you were expecting it to be a 
little more, maybe 20%-25% more, so that takes us to $2,50 0 (head nod)

EXAMPLES OF PRICE JUSTIFICATION
 - Below is a conversation you should have with the prospect

THE "ADD" PORTION:
  
 

The goal here is to justify the price with the quality of the LeafFilter system
.
 
"What did you like best about the LeafFilter?"
 
Let them tell you what they like and then use it for the remainder of this technique
.
 
"A lot of our customers love the fact that we use surgical grade stainless steel

 It will stand the test 
of time and ensure a lifetime of performance

"A lot of our customers love that we use virgin vinyl
.
  They know that because of this the 
 
LeafFilter won t twist, warp, crack, or yellow
.
  They know that it too will ensure a lifetime of performance
.
"
 
"Our customers tell us how important it was to them that we cleaned, realigned, and sealed their 
gutter s before we installed LeafFilter
.
 Our process provides them with peace of mind
.
 In a nutshell, they 
saw a lot of value in knowing that their gutter s were going to function better than brand new ones
.
" 
 
SUMMARY STATEMENT TO ADD:
 
Ł
  
"As a company, we are dedicated to providing the highest quality product for our customers, 
and Im glad you feel that its the right choice for your home
.
"
THE SUBTRACT PORTION:
  The goal here is to "subtract the quality of the LeafFilter system and show 
how making a decision for a lesser priced/quality product would be a disappointment
.
"
"There are ways that we could make this cheaper–

"
 
"Instead

"
"There are ways that we could make this cheaper–

"
 
"Instead of using surgical grade stainless steel we could have used something lik e a nylon window 
screen
.
  Now keep in mind that stuff would stick to it, it would rip and tear and certainly wouldn t stand 
the test of time
.
  You would consider that to be a temporary solution, right?"
 
"It certainly would be a lot cheaper for us to mak e the body of the LeafFilter out of plastic
.
 But, that 
would likely twist, warp, and discolor over time
.
 Im sure you see that this solution wouldn t add value to 
your home, right?"
"Our crews are experts in that this is all they do– all day, every day! It would certainly be a lot cheaper for 
us if we just put LeafFilter on your gutter s without cleaning, re-aligning, or sealing your gutter s
.
 It would 
certainly be a lot cheaper if we didn t reinforce your gutter s with our hidden hanger system

 However, 
they would probably drip and leak, twist, and pull away

gutter s?"

.

gutter s?"
"Most people aren t willing to eliminate these bene˜ts to save a few dollars
...
 What about you?" 

43
 
SUMMARY STATEMENT TO "SUBTRACT":
 
Ł
  
"You see, we could remove all the things you love about the LeafFilter system to get you 
a cheaper price, but you would have to settle for a far inferior product, which Im sure you 
don t want to do
.
"
THE MULTIPLY PORTION:
  Multiply the intangible bene˜ts of owner ship–
 
"Theres a lot of bene˜ts with our LeafFilter system that I am sure you would agree with me are 
tough to put a price tag on
.
"
 
"Fir st of all, your gutter protection system warranty is back ed by the largest gutter protection 
company in the country; would that give you peace of mind?"
 
"Let me show you how LeafFilter puts your satisfaction ˜r st

 When youre completely happy with the crew, the work and the cleanup, you will sign 
the certi˜cate
.
 Then you pay us
.
 Knowing that we do all that without taking a dime from you, let me ask–
.
what risk is it to do business with LeafFilter?"
 
SUMMARY STATEMENT TO MULTIPLY:
 
Ł
  
"LeafFilter will continue to exceed your expectations year after year, protecting your gutter s 
from clogging and protecting your whole-home from the threat of costly water damage
.
"
The Di vide Portion - This is used to break down the difference between what they were hoping the price 
would be and what the Retail price is
.
 
"They say cheap things aren t good and good things aren t cheap
.
 Let me ask you, how much were 
you hoping this was going to cost?"

ap things aren t good and good things aren t cheap
.
 Let me ask you, how much were 
you hoping this was going to cost?"

44
 
Whatever number they give you subtract it from the retail price of their installation
.
 Then di vide 
this number over the next ten year s and divide that number over 365 days in the year
.
  For example if 
the retail price is $3800 and they were hoping it was going to be $20 0 0 the math would be:
 
-
 
$380 0 - $20 0 0 = $180 0/10 year s = $180 
 
-
 
180/365 days = $
.
49/Day
 
SUMMARY STATEMENT TO DIVIDE: 
 
Ł
  
"So I don t think youre saying its not worth the extra 50 cents a day, its just a little more 
than you were hoping to spend– isn t that what youre really saying?"

than you were hoping to spend– isn t that what youre really saying?"
 
 
 

JUSTIFICATION OF DISCOUNTS
 - Its not the size of the discount that moti vates the 
homeowner to buy, but rather the justi˜cation of the discount
.
 In other words, they 
must truly believe that youre offering something special, and that its truly a now 
or never situation
.
 If not well justi˜ed, then theres no reason for the homeowner to 
mak e the decision now
.
  
THE COUPON DISCOUNT
 - Offering a Price Reduction through a company promotion to move the prospect 
closer to purchasing
.
 We offer a 15% discount here
.
THE IMMEDIATE ORDER INCENTIVE
 - Offering a small discount to incenti vize the prospect to move 
forward (typically $250 off) and place an immediate order
.
 
Ł
  
This will be your ˜r st attempt to "close" the sale
.
  Before you offer the Factory Discount, 
you must justify the discount before you drop the price
.
  Without rationalizing the discount, 
dropping the price has little urgency and will not moti vate the prospect to purchase today
.

onalizing the discount, 
dropping the price has little urgency and will not moti vate the prospect to purchase today

Ł
  
So now the scenario is: You have quoted retail price, you have justi˜ed the retail price 
(through the add, subtract, multiply and di vide) and the prospects objection remains, 
"thats a lot of money
.
"
THE KEY POINTS THAT CREATE A REASON TO ASK FOR THE ORDER TODAY:
 
Ł
 
Fir st, justify your reason and discuss your urgency for orders before you offer a discount
.
 
Ł
 
Second, establish the Price and when its available (anytime) to create customer urgency
.
 
Ł
 
Finally, explain the discount and factory direct price available today and ask for the order!

"As youve told me earlier, this is an installation that you de˜nitely want done– if not now, then 
 
certainly sometime in the future, right?"
"Id love to have your business, and Im willing to offer you some HUGE incenti ves to working with me 
while Im here today
.
"
"Our production manager has looked over the schedule for the next several weeks and he has seen a 
need for immediate orders
.
  So, for anyone that is in a position to move their timeframe up from when 
they wanted to do this, to placing an immediate order we can offer you a signi˜cant savings–

"
"Remember, the (quote the retail price as a dollar amount–ex: $5585) is good anytime
.
   But based on 
our need for immediate orders, I can do the whole thing today, for only $4497!"
NOW YOU NEED TO ASK FOR THE ORDER:

the best time to go ahead and get this started?"

The

wouldn t you agree that now is 
the best time to go ahead and get this started?"
DISCUSSION BETWEEN DISCOUNTS
 
Ł
  
There is a chance that the prospect will not say yes after the Factory Discount has been 
offered
.
 This is normal buyer s resistance
.
  Prospects will stall making decisions; this is 
natural and we have a systematic approach to breaking down this buyer s resistance
.
 
 
Ł
  
The k ey strategy to handling the objection from the prospect is to question down the pros
-
pect, and funnel the objection, regardless of what it is, into a price objection
.
 
 
Ł
  
Prospects typically don t like to be ask ed to buy something, but may feel uncomfortable 
saying no
.
 In this case, they will likely offer up an excuse to explain their reluctance
.
 
Ł
 
To turn the prospects excuse for not purchasing in a more legitimate reason, we need to 
  
  
systematically funnel their reluctance into just being about the PRICE
.

HOW TO HANDLE OBJECTIONS
Below is a systematic approach to overcoming objections
.
  Two of the most frequently missed questions 
by sales reps are:
1
.  
In response to "its too much money," we should always say, "Keep in mind that this inv e s t m e n t  
adds value to your home and comes with a transferable lifetime warranty
.
 How much were 
you hoping it would be, again?"

In response to "we need to think about it," we should always say, "Great, how long do you 
need?" Let the prospect answer and then follow up with, "Why a couple days?" This will lead 
to the real objection

The Flexible Installation Discount
 
Ł
 
The next discount should be the "Flexible Installation" discount
.
  
o
 
This discount should be between 20-25% off of Retail Pricing
  
o
  
"There might be something else I could do to save you some money but we would 
have to agree on some conditions
.
"
  
o
 
"
 
If it meant saving some more money could we install your project anytime in the 
next 3-4 weeks
.
  In other words, as soon as tomorrow or as late as four weeks 
from now?"
  
o
 
"Could we install on a Saturday?"
  
o
 
"Could we install on just a 24 hour notice?"
 
Ł
  
We are getting the customer accustomed to saying yes while at the same time justifying 
the discount
.
 Draw out a weekly schedule showing how we install so many jobs a week and 
that we never have to reschedule a customer
.
 "Usually, were not gi ven a lot of notice when 
a customer needs to reschedule, so then we are stuck with a crew not working
.
 So under 
these terms, your LeafFilte

n 
a customer needs to reschedule, so then we are stuck with a crew not working
.
 So under 
these terms, your LeafFilter will be installed based on available crews
.
" 
  
o
  
If you agree to these conditions, what I will do is back-charge a portion of the labor 
bill back to the installation department saving you some money
.
  But you have got 
to promise to be ˚exible with me
.
  
o
 
Now, what I am about to show you is far less than I sell LeafFilter for every day
.
  
    
SO BEFORE I SHOW YOU I AM GOING TO ASK YOU FOR A PERSONALFAVOR.  IF 
WHAT I SHOW YOU LOOKS GOOD TELL ME YES AND WELL GET IT DONE, IF NOT 
TELL ME NO, I CAN TAKE A NO AS GRACIOUSLY AS I CAN TAKE A YES.  BUT CAN 
YOU AT LEAST LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU STAND ON MY PROPOSITIONWHILE 
I AM HERE TODAY?
The previously highlighted section is crucial and must be used every single time, no matter what
.
  Without 
it, you are liable to get a noncommittal
.
The strategy is to get the customer to agree to a yes or no while you are there, thus eliminating the "well 
think about it" or "well let you know" response
.
   Whateve

yes or no while you are there, thus eliminating the "well 
think about it" or "well let you know" response
.
   Whatever their response is, thank them for the decision
.

48
 
Ł
  
If the answer was no, then begin to warm down and put your stuff away as if you are 
conceding defeat
.
  This will lower the prospects defenses and allow them to feel as if they 
have won
.
 
 
Ł
  
At some point bring it back to the gutter project
.
 "I have a long dri ve home and it is going 
to really dri ve me nuts why you folks weren t able to tak e advantage of what I had to 
offer while I was here today
.
  Just to clarify my own thinking, what was the real reason 
you decided to pass?"  Then be quiet
.
  It will almost always be the money
.
 Once this is 
established, presto, you are right back into the close
.
 Dig a little bit, question down and 
ensure that is the money
.
 
THE INVOICE DISCOUNT
 - Offering the lowest acceptable price in order to mak e the sale today

This discount should be $10 0 over our Par Price

  Par = Retail Price - 35% +TheAdmin Fee

This discount is one last attem

discount should be $10 0 over our Par Price
.
  Par = Retail Price - 35% +TheAdmin Fee
.
This discount is one last attempt to get the prospect to make a decision today
.
 Your prospect may give 
you different "reasons" for delaying the buying decision
.
 DONT BE FOOLED BY THIS TACTIC! "I need to 
think about it," "we don t mak e a decision in one day," or "we need to talk to so and so" are their methods 
to avoid making a decision
.
However, it is important to realize that there COULD be another possibility: 
 
Ł
 
You, as a sales per son, did not convince the prospect of the value of the project and you 
  
  
are asking more than they feel it may be worth
.
 
Ł
 
The customer truly may not be able to afford the price you offered
.
 
In order to eliminate both of these scenarios we need to gi ve the prospect one last chance to buy at 
Invoice Pricing
.
"Well, John and Mary, let me ask you, do you know what a factory invoice is?"
"Right, its actually what it costs us to generate an appointment, mak e the materials, and pay everyone 
involved in a sale
.
"

its actually what it costs us to generate an appointment, mak e the materials, and pay everyone 
involved in a sale
.
"

49
"Well I have a factory invoice on your project
.
  I never offer it because its ridiculous
.
"
"If you could get a project done at-cost, especially one that you know you need to get done sooner rather 
than later, it would be an incredibly wise investment
.
"
"Well, heres the invoice price (as you show it to them on a calculator) what do you say?  Do you want to 
get it done?"
COMMON OBJECTIONS AND REBUTTALS
1. WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.
This is always just a stall tactic
.
 Most customer s are leery of buying something right away and may need 
more information or incentive to rationalize or justify a purchase
.
 
 
"
 
You need to think about it? Great! How long do you need?" they will always gi ve a timeframe of 
a couple days to several weeks
.
 
"
 
That soon? Why a couple of days?"  Now really listen to what they say; if you are luck y they may 
di vulge why they need the time
.
If they don t reveal their reluctance, follow up with, "If you don t mind me a

ey may 
di vulge why they need the time
.
If they don t reveal their reluctance, follow up with, "If you don t mind me asking, what phase of the 
transaction do you feel
you need to gi ve more consideration to? Is it whether or not you want to make your gutter s more mainte
-
nance-free? Earlier you told me you want a company lik e mine to do the work, that hasn t changed, has it? 
When we were discussing gutter protection, you said you didn t want any of the other products available
.
 
In fact, you said LeafFilter was the only one you would put on your house, right? I haven t offended you 
any way have I? Well if you don t need to think about any of those things ,the only thing you could have 
left to think about is the price, is that it? Is it just the money?"
2. WE WANT TO SHOP AROUND OR YOU ARE THE FIRST WE HAVE SEEN.
We can t physically stop someone from shopping, so we must systematically walk them through the 
shopping process so that in their minds, you have offered them everything they could ask for in a com
-
pany and gutter protection and that the decision  just comes dow

e offered them everything they could ask for in a com
-
pany and gutter protection and that the decision  just comes down to price
.

50
SEQUENCE
 - "I can appreciate that! There are a lot of things to consider when purchasing gutter protection
.
 
You aren t just saying that to get rid of me are you? Ok ay, great
.
 So if you don t mind me asking, who 
are you going to call? (Let them answer
.
 We want them to genuinely consider this
.
) As you are out there 
shopping, what exactly are you going to be looking for in gutter protection? Something that doesn t 
interfere with the roof? Something that won t allow anything into the gutter s?" If you have done a good 
product demo and a good add, subtract, multiply, and divide, you should be able to easily narrow their 
search again to LeafFilter
.
 "If youre lik e most of my customers, and I think that you are, its not that you 
are looking for a better company or better gutter protection, its just that you want to make sure that you 
are getting the best price
.
 So if you could ˜nd a product just lik e mine with a company just lik e mi

sure that you 
are getting the best price
.
 So if you could ˜nd a product just lik e mine with a company just lik e mine, for 
a lower price, it would be a no-brainer right? Great!"
3. ALTERNATIVE TO SHOP AROUND
 
"We want to shop around; you are the ˜rst gutter guy we have seen
"
SEQUENCE- 
"I understand how you feel
.
 There are a lot of things to consider when youre buying gutter 
protection– a lot more than you thought before I explained about gutter protection right?  Thats usually 
the case, but there are a few more things about gutter protection that you still don t know
.
"
 
"You see, shopping for gutter protection isn t lik e shopping for car s, TVs, or refrigerator s
.
 Lets 
consider a TV, for example
.
 You pick out a model you lik e and you check two or three places for the exact 
model and whoever has the cheapest price is who youre going to buy your TV from
.
 You know that the 
cheapest model was made at the same place under the same conditions as the same model that was 
more expensi ve at the other store right? And thats the way that most retail purchases work
.

the same model that was 
more expensi ve at the other store right? And thats the way that most retail purchases work
.
 But gutter 
protection is completely different
.
"
 
"To put it simply, you can t shop around for LeafFilter! Let me explain why
.
 Remember when I 
showed you how most home improvement projects work? And how LeafFilter is different because we 
handle the whole process our selves? You said you de˜nitely lik ed the LeafFilter and that was what you 
wanted on your house
.
 We are the exclusi ve dealer, so you cant get the LeafFilter anywhere else
.
"
 
"Now, lets assume you did ˜nd a product you lik ed (although we all know you won t
.
)  You will 
hire a contractor, who will buy it from a distributor who bought it from the manufacturer and who will 
then pay a sub-contractor to put it in
.
  All that is ˜ne until there is a problem and you need service
.
  Then 
who are you going to call? Again there is a good chance that you are going to get left holding the bag
.
  Is 
it worth that risk just to save a couple bucks?"
 
"Let me remind you again that here at LeafFil

holding the bag
.
  Is 
it worth that risk just to save a couple bucks?"
 
"Let me remind you again that here at LeafFilter we handle every step of your installation
.
 Our 
lifetime transferable warranty and clog-free guarantee ensures a lifetime of peace of mind
.
 No one else 
has that, and I know thats important to you
.
" 

51
 
"So to sum it all up doesn t it mak e sense to go with a sure thing, a product that doesn t interfere 
with your roof, one that will not let even a grain of sand into your gutter and back ed by a company you 
know you can trust?  So can we go ahead and give it a try?"
4. ALTERNATIVE "THINK ABOUT IT" REBUTTAL
 
"Thats great Mr
.
 Jones!  Im glad that you do want to think about it, because obviously you would 
not waste your time thinking about my offer if you were not interested
.
  I assume you want to think about 
it to reduce your chances of making a mistak e, whether you say yes or no
.
  Is that correct, Mr
.
 Jones? 
Would you agree that the length of time that you think about something is not the important point?  If 
Im reading you right, and I th

e that the length of time that you think about something is not the important point?  If 
Im reading you right, and I think that I am, your prime objective is to be as certain as possible that you 
mak e the right decision, regardless of whether you think about it for two minutes or two days
.
  The right 
decision forYOU is what you want, isn t it Mr
.
 Jones?"
 
"Business people and ef˜ciency experts agree that the best time to mak e accurate decisions is 
when you have the necessary facts in front of you
.
  This way your mind is aimed at making the best 
decision for you based on factual information which is fresh in your mind
.
  Forgotten facts or confused 
information almost always lead to a bad decision
.
  With this in mind, could we think together for a minute 
to mak e sure we arri ve at the right decision, which is what you want, isn t it, Mr
.
 Jones?"
Now question down the prospect turning the objection to price
.
5
.
We never mak e snap decisions
This is another common stall tactic
.
 More often than not, the hidden objection is price
.
 We need to uncover  
and overco

is another common stall tactic
.
 More often than not, the hidden objection is price
.
 We need to uncover  
and overcome this
.
 For example, every prospect would buy LeafFilter for their home for just ten dollar s if  
gi ven the opportunity
...
 even the ones that say they never mak e snap decisions! Its not that they don t mak e  
snap decisions, its just that we haven t gi ven them enough information or reasons to mak e the decision
.
 
 
"Mr
.
 and Mr s
.
 Jones, business people and decision making experts agree that the best time to 
mak e a decision lik e this is when all the facts and ˜gures are right at your ˜ngertips while your mind isn t 
clouded by the other issues of the day
.
"
"When weve gone back and ask ed our customers that needed to think about it, theyve told us that the 
decision came down to just four things:"
 
1
.
 Do you need it? (Con˜rm that they do)
 
2
.
 Do you like it? (Con˜rm that they like it)
 
3
.
 Can you afford it? (Con˜rm that they can afford it)

 Do you like it? (Con˜rm that they like it)
 
3
.
 Can you afford it? (Con˜rm that they can afford it)

52
 
4
.
 Can you save money by doing it now? (Assure them that they are)
"They say that if you can say yes to all of these questions, then youve made a good decision
.
  So, all 
indications are that this would be a good decision for you
.
  So can we go ahead and gi ve it a try?"
6. WEVE HAD A LOWER PRICE.
"Thats ˜ne Mr
.
 Jones; theres always someone out there that sells a cheaper product
.
 You always get 
what you pay for, and cheap is never good and good is never cheap
.
 Consider this - LeafFilter has been an 
industry leader since 20 05
.
 You get a lifetime warranty, a company that stands behind their product, and 
nothing but water in your gutter
.
 Don t you think that what I have to offer is truly the better investment?"
CUSTOMER REPSONSE:  STILL WANT TO WAIT–
OPTION CLOSE
Rep:  I can understand; however, there are really only three options facing you at this time and  these 
options don t change, regardless of when you decide to proceed– whether its n

ptions facing you at this time and  these 
options don t change, regardless of when you decide to proceed– whether its now, 1 month from now 
or one year from now
.
The ˜rst option is to DO NOTHING– however, you mentioned earlier that you need to do something to 
improve your current situation, so leaving things the way they are really isn t an option
.
  So lets dismiss 
that, right?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "OK"
Well your second option is to "roll the dice" and use a CHEAP company, with CHEAP materials, CHEAP 
installer s, CHEAP warranty and CHEAP service, for a CHEAP price
.
 However, youve convinced me that 
you want to do this improvement just once and not over and over
.
 Im sure you know by now that good 
things are seldom cheap, and cheap things are seldom good
.
 You get what you pay for, right? Realistically, 
you cant pay a little and get a lot
.
 Its for this reason that our customer s don t even consider devaluing 
their home with something cheap
.
Now, the THIRD OPTION is by far the wisest
.
 Select the #1 gutter protection company in North America 
and get state-of-the-art

THIRD OPTION is by far the wisest
.
 Select the #1 gutter protection company in North America 
and get state-of-the-art high-quality gutter guards that are back ed by a warranty and service program 
to protect your investment
.
 The worst thing that could happen is you get the product you want and 
increased value in your home

CUSTOMER RESPONSE:  WE ALWAYS GET THREE PRICES–

53
REP:
  I can appreciate how you feel, however there are only three results that could happen when collecting 
prices from contractors listed in the yellow pages–
The ˜r st thing that could happen is that you recei ve a higher price
.
  If you recei ved a higher price, is it safe 
to say you would call me back to have us do the work for you?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Yes–"
REP:
  Great!  The second thing that could happen is that you recei ve an EQUAL price
.
  Is it also safe for me 
to say that if you received an EQUAL price, you would still call me back and have us do the work?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Yes–"
REP:
 So, in two of the three possibilities, you want LeafFilter to do the work for you, right?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Yes–"
REP:
  Well, the third thing that could happen is that you recei ve is a CHEAP price, however considering 
that CHEAP things are seldom good and good things are seldom CHEAP, its probably safe for me to say 
that youre not looking for somethin

s are seldom good and good things are seldom CHEAP, its probably safe for me to say 
that youre not looking for something CHEAP, am I right?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Thats right–"
REP:
  Youre an intelligent consumer; you know that you get what you pay for
.
  Correct me if Im wrong, I 
think youre saying that you want the best VALUE for your dollar, not necessarily the CHEAPEST price, is 
that fair to say?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Yes–"
REP:
  Considering that more families lik e your s have selected us for their gutter protection needs over 
anyone else and would mak e that same decision all over again, wouldn t it stand to reason that they 
purchased because LeafFilter delivered the bestVALUE?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
"I guess so–"
REP:
  Isn t it better to spend a little more than you expected to in order to recei ve the best, as compared 
to spending what you wanted to and end up with an inferior company using sub-standard products and 
service?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Yes–"
REP:
  What do you say we get the paperwork out of the way and you can join LeafFilter as a satis˜ed 
customer?  All I nee

P:
  What do you say we get the paperwork out of the way and you can join LeafFilter as a satis˜ed

  Youll love your new gutters

CUSTOMER RESPONSE:  "TOO MUCH MONEY–"
 
TRADING MONEY CLOSE
REP:
  I understand how you feel, however if you gi ve us, lets say, $4,0 0 0 and they gi ve you back $4,50 0 
or more in added value to your home, it would be a great thing to do, right?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Yes–"
REP:
  Well, thats exactly what youre getting here
.
  Every real estate expert agrees that you increase the 
value of your home dollar for dollar of what you put into your roof
.
  
If LeafFilter can put me in the position where I can:

Put a comfortable amount down with the order;
2)

CUSTOMER RESPONSE:  "WERE GOING TO BE MOVING SOON–"
WERE MOVING - HOUSE A/B CLOSE
REP:
  I understand, I only hope that you can appreciate that this is an investment
.
  It is not lik e a car that 
depreciates over time, it appreciates the value of your home immediately
.
  I guess what youre saying is 
that if you felt con˜dent that this improvement was an investment that will mak e you money and was 
affordable, you would have been more positive about moving forward, right?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Sure–"
REP:
  Well, for just a moment, try to think back to when you were looking to purchase this home
.
  Real 
estate experts say that most folks see between 5 and 10 listings before actually buying a property

  Is that

REP:
  For conver sation sak e, assume for a minute that you are considering two homes on this street, both 
identical, however with one exception
.
  (Draw two triangles on the back of your pricing form)
REP:
  One home has an updated roof and gutter protection and the other one looks lik e the gutter s you 
have right now
.
  Lets call the home with the gutter protection A, (write a letter "A" in the middle of the 
˜r st triangle) and the other home, house B (write the letter "B" in the middle of the second triangle)
.
 
Appropriately, what is the value of your home at this time 1, 2, or $300,00 0?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "$20 0,0 0 0–"
REP: 
 Great, lets assume then that house B is on the mark et for $20 0,0 0 0 (write $20 0,0 0 0 in the middle of 
the triangle mark ed "B") and house A is selling for $205,0 0 0, which includes the cost of the needed gutter 
protection at the manufacturers suggested retail price
.
  (Write $205,0 0 0 in the middle of the triangle

eeded gutter 
protection at the manufacturers suggested retail price
.
  (Write $205,0 0 0 in the middle of the triangle 
mark ed "A")
REP:
  Since a home buyer would amortize the cost of the gutter protection over a 30 year mortgage, the 
difference on the monthly installment from houseA compared to house B is only approximately $25 a 
month
.
  (Rule of thumb: $50 mo
.
 per $10,0 0 0 ˜nanced over 30 year s)
.
  Considering that house A has up-
dated gutter protection and only costs approximately $25 a month more to own, which home would you 
buy if you had to do it all over again?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "House A–"
REP:
  So its fair to say then that you feel this improvement is a good value and it really boils down to how 
to ˜t this into your budget, right?
CUSTOMER RESPONSE:
 "Yes–"
REP:
 Well lets get the work scheduled

  Which one of these plans works best for you?

"I WANT TO PAY CASH."
I can under stand that
.
  May I suggest that many of my customer s use our ˚exible budget plan and 
leave their cash in the bank for emergencies?  Most all of our customers feel that they might as well use 
someone elses money instead of their own– There are no pre-payment penalties, and you can pay if off 
whenever you want to
.
  Which one of these works best for you?
"I WANT TO TALK TO MY (SON, DAUGHTER, NEIGHBOR, ETC.)"
If they told you to do it with us, would you do it?  If they told you don t do it, would you not do it?  Are you 
prepared to hold them responsible if they tell you to use someone else and it turns out a disaster?  Why 
risk your home and your relationship?  Most families I meet with feel that the risk is not worth the gain

They would want thi

 I know I do! However, lets look at those priorities
.
 Most peoples biggest priority is their 
home, their greatest investment
.
 Then there are the other expenses, too, lik e the car– We all need a car, 
but their expenses add up quick
.
 Then you might have credit cards, vacation, clothes
...
 But how many 
of those thing are investments? Only your home
.
 What better investment is there than PROTECTING 
YOUR HOME?Thats why most of our customer s use our budget plan; they can invest in their home while 
focusing on other priorities, too
.
 Which one of these would work best for you?
"TOO MUCH MONEY."
Im not here to add an obligation to you
.
  Im here to gi ve you a chance to do something about the 
obligation you already have
.
  When you bought your home 20 year s ago, didn t you purchase it with the 
intent of increasing its value and enhancing your enjoyment?  Well d

ome 20 year s ago, didn t you purchase it with the 
intent of increasing its value and enhancing your enjoyment?  Well doesn t this improvement gi ve you 
both of those and doesn t it coincide with the same decision you made 20 year s ago?

ONE-LEGGER APPOINTMENTS

59
These types of appointments are different and need to be handled as such
.
 A one-leg appointment refer s 
to a lead where only one homeowner is present
.
  Sometimes that homeowner does have the capability of  
making the decision without speaking to the other per son
.
  Sometimes that homeowner will use that fact  
to put off the decision
.
  In this case, we need an alternati ve strategy to trying to sell that prospect
.
The standard steps of the presentation remain the same
.
We still need to warm up, do a great  
presentation, eliminate the competition, and price condition
.
Youll ˜nd out whether they will be able to 
make the decision without the other homeowner present when you get to the pre-close
.
 If the homeowner  
gi ves an objection after your pre-close attempt, then you should roll into a secondary at

e-close
.
 If the homeowner  
gi ves an objection after your pre-close attempt, then you should roll into a secondary attempt
.
There are two effecti ve ways of dealing with a one-leg
.
1
.  
When initially showing the Retail Price,Do not in˚ate it, show the actual retail pricing 
for the job
.
This allows us to give a discount down to the par price without losing our 
credibility
.
After the ˜rst price is shown, you should still do an add, subtract, multiply 
and di vide
.
When you ask the homeowner what they think, they will almost always say, 
"Looks good, I just have to talk to my spouse
.
"
Now you should attempt two things
.
  The ˜r st is focus on what they would do if it was just up to them
.
 
The second is to ˜nd out when the other homeowner will be home and how soon they can talk about it
.
 
You may have to lead them down this path:
 
"So Mr
.
 Jones let me ask you, what time does your wife get home?"
 
"When she gets back, I trust you will tell her that I was here and what we talk ed about?"
 
"So you will tell her that in your opinion this is by far the best product ava

I was here and what we talk ed about?"
 
"So you will tell her that in your opinion this is by far the best product available even though it is 
  
 
  priced within the average of the industry?"
Now is the time to set up the close
.
 First, tell the homeowner that you have a way to save them a  
considerable amount of money
.
Tell them about the commercial pricing, and ask that they let us know their decision by 9 a
.
m
.
 tomorrow
.
 
This is when we must have the product for the commercial job ordered
.
Fill out and leave behind a contract (without the homeowner signing it) so that their spouse can see it  
and under stand exactly what were proposing
.
 Leave the prospect a folder with a one-leg brochure, the  
contract, and a business card
.
 
THE PRICE YOU THEN OFFER THE HOMEOWNER SHOULD BE $100 OVER PAR***
 
Then mak e sure you follow up with the homeowner before the time you gave them
.
 
2
.  
Another way to attempt to close the sale is to just work the lead
.
 Get email addresses and  
cell phone numbers
.
 Then follow up until the lead is dead
.
  Stop by and visit with th

d
.
 Get email addresses and

 Then follow up until the lead is dead

  Stop by and visit with the other  
homeowner when possible

K-STYLE GUTTERS AND ACCESSORIES

90
K-STYLE GUTTERS
 
Ł
  
Seamless K-style gutter s are the most popular style of gutter installed today
.
 
 
Ł
 
Residential K-style gutter s come in both 5" and 6" sizes
.
 
Ł
  
The size of the gutter is determined by the depth of the top of the gutter as shown 
 
on diagram 1-1
.
 
Ł
  
5" gutter s are more common on residential homes and small businesses
.
 This size gutter 
will handle just about any amount of water that drains off smaller roofs
.
  5" gutter s are 
more commonly paired with 2x3 down spouts, however, the larger 3x4 down spouts can 
be added in areas that require more water drainage
.
 
Ł
  
6" gutter s are commonly used on larger homes, commercial buildings, garages and pole 
barns
.
  Larger roofs that drain large amounts of water need a gutter system that can catch 
and drain the rain water more quickly
.
  6" gutters are paired with 3x4 down spouts
.
 The 
larger gutters and down spouts make a great system for structures with large roof

 The 
larger gutters and down spouts make a great system for structures with large roof spans

K-STYLE END CAPS
 
Ł
 
A gutter end cap is the ˜tting that attaches to and closes off the end of the gutter
.
 
Ł
 
End caps will be seen at each end of a straight gutter run
.
  (see diagram 1-2)
 
Ł
 
End caps are sold for both left ends and right ends

K-STYLE GUTTER HANGERS
 
Ł
  
A gutter is only as good as the hanger that is used to support it
.
  Knowing which gutter 
hanger to use is half the battle
.
 
Ł
  
A K-style hidden hanger is the most popular hanger used today
.
 However, it can depend 
on the geographic region
.
  
K-STYLE GUTTER HANGERS (HIDDEN HANGERS)
 
Ł
  
A hidden hanger is used on a straight fascia
.
  The hanger slides under the front lip of the

93
K-STYLE GUTTER HANGERS    (SPIKE AND FERRULE)
 
Ł
  
The spik e and ferrule is also used on a straight fascia
.
 Because it fastens through the 
gutter, its more apt than other hanger types to pull out of the fascia due to expansion and

K-STYLE GUTTER HANGERS    (POST HANGERS)
 
Ł
  
Post Hangers are also typically used when there is no fascia board to mount the gutter to
.
 
The post hanger is similar to the T-Bar except with a nut and bolt attached to the hanger
.
  
The hanger is slid into the front lip of the top of the gutter and screwed to the back
.
 The 
strap is then nailed into the roof deck
.
K-STYLE GUTTER HANGERS    (WRAP AROUND STRAPS)
 
Ł
  
Wrap around straps, similar to T-bar s, are used when there is no fascia to attach the gutter 
to or the fascia is slanted
.
 The K-Style wrap around strap goes all the way around the 
outside of the gutter and gi ves the gutter better support than theT-Strap Hanger
.

outside of the gutter and gi ves the gutter better support than theT-Strap Hanger
.

95
K-STYLE GUTTER HANGERS    (GUTTER WEDGES)
 
Ł
  
Gutter wedges are used with a slanted fascia to push the bottom of the gutter out so that 
the gutter is perpendicular with the ground instead of slanted
.
 
Ł
  
Gutter wedges should be installed on the same spacing as the hidden hangers, which are 
recommended every 24" - 32"
.
 
Ł
  
Gutter wedges only work with roof slopes ranging from 3-12 to 4-12
.

96
K-STYLE MITERS (CORNERS)
 
Ł
  
There are four main types of miters used
.

DOWNSPOUTS
 
Ł
  
A downspout is a pipe for conveying rain water from a roof or gutter to the ground 
 
or to a drain
.
 
Ł
  
Downspouts are sold in 10 ft
.
 lengths
.
 
Ł
  
Downspout dimensions are sized according to the roof area they drain
.
 
Ł
  
The following is the rule of thumb used in the industry:

ELBOWS
 
Ł
  
Elbows are ˜ttings that attach to the downspout
.
 One end of the gutter elbow is crimped 
so that it can ˜t inside another elbow or downspout
.
 
 
Ł
  
There are two types of elbows that are most commonly used, the "A" elbow, 
 
and the"B" elbow
.
ELBOWS (CONT.)
 
Ł
  
What is the difference between an "A" elbow and a"B" elbow?
   
-
 
When looking directly at the wall with the downspout on it (so you can see the wide sur
-
face of the downspout), an "A" elbow will bring the gutter straight out toward you
.
  If its 
a"B" elbow, the downspout will turn to the left or the right
.

101
ELBOW COMPARISON (AS VIEWED ON HOME)
ELBOWS (CONT.)
 
Ł
  
In most common applications, two elbows coming from the gutter are used to span the 
length of the eave so the downspout can be directly mounted to the wall of the structure

102
ELBOWS (CONT.)
 
Ł
  
Elbows are often used at the bottom of the downspout at ground level to direct drainage 
in a particular direction away from the foundation
.
PIPE BANDS
 
Ł
  
Pipe bands are used to secure the downspout to the siding, brick, or wood 
 
corner of the home
.
 
Ł
  
Pipe bands can be purchased prefabricated or made on-site from coil stock
.

103
FASTENERS

Long screws are used for fastening the gutter hanger s to the fascia board as well as 
 
fastening downspout straps to wood, vinyl, and aluminum siding

SPLASH GUARDS
 
Ł
  
Splash Guards are made of gutter coil and are used to prevent the over˚ow of water at 
the inside corners of the home where two or more roofs meet to create a valley
.

DOWN SPOUT EXTENSIONS
 
Ł
  
Downspout extensions are installed where there is currently a 2nd ˚oor downspout 
draining on a 1st ˚oor roof
.
 
Ł
  
Downspouts draining on a 1st ˚oor roof will often be a problem area for water over˚ow
.
  
This is caused by the extra ˚ow of water that comes from the downspout along with the 
rain that naturally drains down the roof
.
 
Ł
  
The photo below is an example of a home that would bene˜t from a downspout extension

Lumber is sold by its nominal size, not by the actual thickness and width
.
  For example, a 
nominal 2x4 actually measures 1-1/2" thick x 3-1/2" wide after it is dressed
.
  Lumber mills 
"dress" the wood to create straight sides, which is why the actual thickness and width 
ends up smaller

LEAFFILTER GUTTER PROTECTION: 
 
MODULAR SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR CUSTOM FIT
LeafFilter Gutter Protection is a modular system of components which allows for a custom ˜t to the 
customer s home
.
 The custom ˜t is achieved by using the best ˜tting Main Body and Rear Recei ver for 
each particular gutter run on the Customers home
.
 Since gutter styles, gutter widths, metal drip edges, 
metal roof starter s and gutter connection hardware may vary with each gutter run on the customer s 
home, LeafFilter allows the installer to accommodate each of these application conditions as it is 
encountered on the home
.
 LeafFilter also uses a Front Recei ver that is hidden on top of the front lip of 
the gutter in order that the assembled product is less visible to the customer

NO WHEELS!!
 
-Pencil
 
-Note pad
GUTTERS
STEP 1: WHERE DO YOU WANT GUTTERS?
 
-
 
Look at the roof and determine where you 
want gutters
.
˛ Gutter s are always at the 
eave edge of a roof
.
˛ (Where the roof runs 
horizontally
.
)

.
˛ Gutter s are always at the 
eave edge of a roof
.
˛ (Where the roof runs

.
)

139
STEP 2: MEASURE WHERE YOU WANT THE GUTTERS TO RUN.
 
-
 
Measuring along the ground, estimating where the gutter s will be on the roof is the best idea
.
˛ 
Some people hook the tape measure on the side of the house
.
  For these measurements, the 
width of the sof˜t must be added
.
˛ Mark 1st ˚oor, 2nd ˚oor, and 3rd ˚oor measurements
.
 Add 
1 ft
.
 to every measurement to ensure accuracy
.
 
SEE DIAGRAM 5-1
 
STEP 3: COUNT ANY CORNERS YOU MAY NEED.
 
-
 
If your gutter bends or changes direction, that would be a corner you need to note

Downspouts occur about every 20-30 feet for small downspouts and 30-40 feet for large down
-
spouts
.
˛ If you need/want the large ones, k eep it constant throughout the house
.
  Remember, 
down spouts are sold in 10 ft

 lengths, so always round up to the next 10 ft
.
 increment
.
 
-Example:
 
˛Ł
  
Your measurements come out to be 24-6" of down spout
.
 You will need to account for 
30 ft
.
STEP 5: EVALUATE YOUR ELBOWS.
 
-
 
Elbows will be counted for every turn needed in the down spout
.
  Refer to Section One for 
descriptions of"A" and"B" elbows
.
 
-Example:
 
˛Ł
  
You need a down spout on the rear of the home that will drain onto the ground
.
 You will 
need (2) elbows to get from the bottom of the gutter to the wall of the house, and (1) 
elbow at the bottom of the down spout to direct the water away from the home
.

Here is a tip that can help you determine what story of the house you are measuring 
gutter s for when you can t get your tape up the side of the house:
  
-
 
Measure a piece of siding
.
  Next, count how many pieces of siding run up the side of 
the house to the sof˜t
.
 Then, multiply that number by the size of the siding and di vide it 
by 12
.
 
˛Ł
 
 
Example:
  
-John measures the  vinyl siding and ˜nds that one panel is 8"
.
  
  
-John then counts the number of panels and comes up with 34
.
 
˛Ł
 
Math
  
-8" x 34 = 272"
  
-272" / 12" = 22
.
6 ft
.
 
 
-
 
Since your measurement was actually tak en up to the sof˜t, round up to the next foot 
to
 account for the fascia
.
  
-In this example, the answer is 23 ft
.
 Which is considered 2nd story
.

You now have a more accurate story measurement
